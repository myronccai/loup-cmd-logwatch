# Check, test and run commands for this host-scripted Loup project.
#
# The programs are scripts (bin/*.lpscr) that `loup run` executes from
# source. A script entry cannot be compiled (E-BUILD-COMPILED), so there is
# no build target. On Linux x86-64 `loup` is the self-hosted driver and
# `loup-bootstrap` is Stage0; `check` and `test` need Stage0 there. On macOS,
# Windows and Linux arm64 both names run Stage0, so the targets work unchanged.
